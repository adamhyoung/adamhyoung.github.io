<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3"><em>This comprehensive guide explains how to submit receipts for reimbursement under the Ontario Autism Program. It covers the step-by-step process of using the AccessOAP portal, details what information your receipts should include (for taxis, camps, deposits, etc.), clarifies rules about funding periods (including the use of letters of recommendation and timing of expenses), answers frequently asked questions from real parents, and suggests improvements to the process. All information is drawn from official guidelines and community experiences, with citations for reference.</em></p>
<h2 class="code-line" data-line-start=4 data-line-end=5 ><a id="1_Reimbursement_Process_StepbyStep_Instructions_4"></a>1. Reimbursement Process: Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="7"><strong>Step 1 – Gather All Required Documentation:</strong> Before logging into the OAP portal, collect all receipts and any supporting documents:</p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="10">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="9"><strong>Receipts/Invoices</strong> for each expense you want reimbursed (therapy sessions, equipment purchases, transportation fares, etc.). Make sure they are <strong>itemized and official</strong> (see Section 2 for details on what a valid receipt includes).</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="10" data-line-end="12">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="10" data-line-end="11"><strong>Letters of Recommendation</strong> for any expenses that require them. In OAP, certain purchases (like technology devices or therapy equipment) <strong>must</strong> be justified by a letter from a qualified professional​<a href="https://www.atamic-canada.com/oap-approved-therapy#:~:text=%2A%20,overseeing%20services%20to%20the%20child">atamic-canada.com</a>​<a href="https://www.atamic-canada.com/oap-approved-therapy#:~:text=%2A%20,to%20support%20a%20child%2Fyouth%E2%80%99s%20goals">atamic-canada.com</a>. Ensure you have this letter (scanned or digital copy) if you’re claiming such items.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="12" data-line-end="13">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="12" data-line-end="13"><strong>OAP Reference Number</strong> and child’s details may be needed on forms. (Your OAP reference number can be found on official correspondence or in your AccessOAP account).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="15" data-line-end="16"><strong>Step 2 – Log in to the AccessOAP Portal:</strong> Go to the <strong>AccessOAP Family Portal</strong> and log in with your account. Once logged in, navigate to the funding or reimbursement section of your child’s profile. (If you have not created an account, you can do so on the AccessOAP website. Families in the new needs-based OAP use this portal for expense submission; those still finishing a <strong>Childhood Budget</strong> or <strong>Interim One-Time Funding</strong> may use a PDF/online expense form instead​<a href="https://peelautismresourceblog.wordpress.com/2021/02/08/oap-expense-tracking-form/#:~:text=If%20you%E2%80%99ve%20received%20a%20Childhood,and%20sent%20all%20at%20once">peelautismresourceblog.wordpress.com</a>, but as of 2025 most reimbursements are handled in the portal.)</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="17" data-line-end="18"><strong>Step 3 – Start a New Expense Claim:</strong> In the portal, find the option to “Submit Expenses” or “Add Invoice/Receipt.” This will usually open a form where you enter details for each expense. Fill in the required fields for the expense:</p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="19" data-line-end="21">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="19" data-line-end="20"><strong>Date of service/purchase:</strong> This should match the date on the receipt or the date the service was provided.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="21" data-line-end="23">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="21" data-line-end="22"><strong>Provider or Vendor Name:</strong> The name of the therapist, service provider, store, camp, or taxi company that issued the receipt.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="23" data-line-end="25">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="23" data-line-end="24"><strong>Description of Service/Item:</strong> A brief description (e.g. <em>“Speech therapy session,” “ABA therapy – 2 hours,” “Occupational therapy equipment – sensory swing,” “Taxi to ABA clinic,”</em> etc.).</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="25" data-line-end="26">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="25" data-line-end="26"><strong>Amount Paid:</strong> The total amount you paid, as shown on the receipt. <em>(Note: The OAP funding covers the <strong>actual paid cost</strong> of eligible services/items, including any tax. You cannot claim for future unpaid balances. For example, if you paid a deposit on a camp, only that deposit amount is claimable now – see Section 4 on future expenses.)</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="28" data-line-end="29"><strong>Step 4 – Attach Receipt (and Letter if required):</strong> Upload a clear scan or photo of the <strong>receipt/invoice</strong> for that expense. The portal allows you to attach image files or PDFs. <strong>Attach the letter of recommendation</strong> if this expense requires one (for instance, equipment or technology purchases need an accompanying professional’s letter recommending it for your child’s needs​<a href="https://www.atamic-canada.com/oap-approved-therapy#:~:text=%2A%20,overseeing%20services%20to%20the%20child">atamic-canada.com</a>). Ensure the letter is signed and on official letterhead if possible, detailing the item and why it’s needed (more on letters in Section 4 FAQ). You can attach multiple files if needed (e.g. receipt + letter). For therapy services, you generally don’t need a letter (the therapist’s invoice is sufficient). For transportation like taxis, just attach the taxi receipt.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="30" data-line-end="31"><strong>Step 5 – Review and Submit:</strong> Double-check all entries. It’s crucial that the information you entered matches the documents:</p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="32" data-line-end="34">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="32" data-line-end="33">The <strong>provider name</strong> and <strong>amount</strong> in the portal form should match what’s on the receipt.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="34" data-line-end="35">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="34" data-line-end="35">Verify that for every expense listed, you have attached the correct receipt, and for every attached letter, you’ve listed the corresponding expense. Once confirmed, submit the expenses. The system will upload your documents and record your claim. After submission, you should see the expenses listed as “Pending” or “In Review” in your portal account.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="37" data-line-end="38"><strong>Step 6 – Confirmation and Follow-Up:</strong> The AccessOAP system will review your submission. You may not need to mail anything if everything was uploaded. Typically:</p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="39" data-line-end="41">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="39" data-line-end="40"><strong>Automatic Approvals:</strong> Smaller therapy invoices (often under a certain threshold like $200) may be auto-approved quickly, sometimes within a week​<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/ontarioautismcoalition/posts/10160758962513645/#:~:text=,If%20they%20are">facebook.com</a>. You might see the status change to approved and the amount deducted from your funding balance.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="41" data-line-end="43">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="41" data-line-end="42"><strong>Manual Reviews:</strong> Larger expenses or non-therapy items (equipment, tech, large block fees) undergo manual review by the OAP team. These can take longer (several weeks)​<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/ontarioautismcoalition/posts/10160091798733645/#:~:text=Facebook%20www,which%20is%20a%20real%20concern">facebook.com</a>, because the reviewers verify the receipt details and the attached letter of recommendation if applicable. For example, one parent noted that <strong>ABA sessions and speech therapy receipts were approved in under a week, whereas an equipment purchase (with the required letter) took over a month to be processed</strong> – this indicates the extra scrutiny on items requiring justification.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="43" data-line-end="44">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="43" data-line-end="44"><strong>Corrections/Requests:</strong> If something is missing or unclear (e.g. a receipt is incomplete or no letter was provided for an equipment claim), the OAP team may send you a message through the portal requesting additional documents. <em>Be sure to check the portal’s message center or your email for any communications.</em> In such cases, <strong>you cannot edit a submitted claim directly</strong>. Instead, you might be asked to upload supplementary documents (e.g. a clearer receipt scan or the missing letter) or, if the claim was rejected, to re-submit it with corrections. <em>(The system currently doesn’t allow editing an expense once submitted, so any fixes usually involve providing more info through an additional upload or new entry.)</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="46" data-line-end="47"><strong>Step 7 – Reimbursement Payment:</strong> If you had not yet received the funds (in some cases, OAP funding is given as an advance lump sum to spend; in other cases or future installments, you submit expenses first), expect the reimbursement or next funding installment to be processed after approval. For families on <strong>direct funding</strong> (where you got a deposit upfront), you won’t receive extra payment for each receipt – rather, your submitted expenses are accounted against that funding. But if you are due another installment (for example, some families receive funding in two parts and must report spending the first part to get the second), the approval of your expense report triggers the next payment. According to the program’s instructions, _“the expense reporting form allows families to report how their funding was spent in order to receive the next payment installment or to reconcile their annual payment”_​<a href="https://forms.mgcs.gov.on.ca/dataset/on00294#:~:text=Ontario%20Autism%20Program%20,Reporting%20for%20Core%20Clinical%20Services">forms.mgcs.gov.on.ca</a>. In practice, once your expenses are accepted, any <strong>next payment</strong> (or reimbursement if you were fronting costs) should arrive within a few weeks. Many parents report that once expenses show as “Processed” or “Approved” in the portal, the direct deposit to their bank follows within about 1–2 weeks (often the government processes payments on a set weekly schedule, e.g. on Wednesdays​<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/ontarioautismcoalition/posts/10161216200298645/#:~:text=Just%20a%20question%20how%20long,not%20today%2C%20next%20week%20then">facebook.com</a>).</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="48" data-line-end="49"><strong>Special Cases in Submission:</strong> During the above process, be mindful of a few special scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="50" data-line-end="52">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="50" data-line-end="51">*Submitting <em><em>Transportation Expenses (Taxi/Uber/Public Transit):</em> These are eligible expenses under OAP if they are for travel to and from an eligible service (such as therapy appointments)​<a href="https://www.atamic-canada.com/oap-approved-therapy#:~:text=and%20staff%20orientation%20and%20training,to%20support%20service%20delivery">atamic-canada.com</a>. In the portal, you would enter the taxi company (or Uber, etc) as the provider, the date of the ride, and the fare amount. Attach the ride receipt. Ensure the receipt shows the date and amount clearly. (If you have multiple taxi receipts, you may need to enter each trip separately unless the provider issued a monthly invoice.)</em></p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="52" data-line-end="54">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="52" data-line-end="53">*Submitting <strong>Deposits or Advance Payments:</strong> Be cautious here – the OAP <strong>does not generally cover advance payments for services that have not occurred yet</strong>. According to OAP guidelines, “advanced payments/deposits are not covered by AccessOAP”​<a href="https://endlessabilities.ca/faqs/#:~:text=FAQs%20,not%20covered%20by%20Access%20OAP">endlessabilities.ca</a>. This means if you paid a deposit for a future program (like a summer camp happening in August), you might <strong>not</strong> be able to claim it now unless the service falls in the current funding period and the program considers the deposit as a payment for current deliverables. As a rule, only claim expenses for services/goods <strong>already provided or delivered</strong> within your funding period. (More on this in Section 4 FAQ.)</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="54" data-line-end="56">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="54" data-line-end="55"><em>Submitting <strong>Multiple Receipts at Once:</strong> The portal allows you to add multiple expense entries before final submission. You can batch-upload all your receipts for the period. Many parents choose to submit expenses as they go (e.g. upload each month) to avoid a last-minute rush. The system will keep a running total against your funding allocation. Just remember to hit “Submit” at the end of the entry session and ensure each expense has its documentation attached.</em></p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="56" data-line-end="57">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="56" data-line-end="57"><em>If Not Using Portal (Older cases):</em> If you are still required to use the paper/online <strong>Expense Form</strong> (for example, if you have a remaining Childhood Budget or Interim one-time funding that isn’t managed in AccessOAP), the steps are similar: fill out the form with expense details, but <strong>do not</strong> send in the physical receipts with that <a href="http://xn--formontario-yd3f.ca">form​ontario.ca</a>. Instead, you keep your original receipts on file for 7 years (in case of audit)<a href="http://xn--ontario-zz6c.ca">​ontario.ca</a>. The ministry expects the form to be submitted within 60 days of your funding period end​<a href="https://peelautismresourceblog.wordpress.com/2021/02/08/oap-expense-tracking-form/#:~:text=If%20you%E2%80%99ve%20received%20a%20Childhood,and%20sent%20all%20at%20once">peelautismresourceblog.wordpress.com</a>. They will review the reported expenses and may request receipts later if needed. Always retain your receipts!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="59" data-line-end="60">By following these steps, you will have properly submitted your receipts. Next, we’ll look at what a <strong>“valid” receipt</strong> should contain and specific examples (taxi fares, camp deposits, etc.) to ensure your documentation meets OAP requirements.</p>
<h2 class="code-line" data-line-start=61 data-line-end=62 ><a id="2_Annotated_Examples_of_Valid_Receipts_Taxi_Deposit_etc_61"></a>2. Annotated Examples of Valid Receipts (Taxi, Deposit, etc.)</h2>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="63" data-line-end="64">Proper documentation is key to a smooth reimbursement. Each receipt or invoice you submit should clearly show certain information so that OAP administrators can verify the expense. Below are examples of what valid receipts look like for different expense types, with annotations on the required details:</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="65" data-line-end="66"><strong>Example 2.1: Taxi or Transportation Receipt</strong> – <em>Suppose you took a taxi to your child’s therapy session.</em> A valid taxi receipt should include:</p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="67" data-line-end="69">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="67" data-line-end="68"><strong>Provider Details:</strong> Name of the taxi company (e.g., <em>City Cab Co.</em>) and possibly the taxi’s unique identifier (like plate number or driver ID). This shows who provided the service.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="69" data-line-end="71">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="69" data-line-end="70"><strong>Date and Time of Service:</strong> The date (and ideally time) of the ride, confirming it took place during your funding period and correlating with an appointment day.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="71" data-line-end="73">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="71" data-line-end="72"><strong>Fare Amount:</strong> The total cost of the ride. Make sure any taxes or tips are either included or noted. (It’s okay if the receipt just shows a total; that is the amount you claim.)</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="73" data-line-end="75">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="73" data-line-end="74"><strong>Proof of Payment:</strong> Some taxi receipts indicate the payment method or have a stamp indicating it was paid. If your receipt is just a meter printout, that’s fine – by submitting it, you are attesting you paid that amount. If it’s an Uber or Lyft, the emailed receipt usually shows the last 4 digits of your card, etc., which is sufficient proof of payment as well.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="75" data-line-end="76">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="75" data-line-end="76"><strong>Passenger/Route (if available):</strong> Not all receipts show this, but if yours notes the pickup/dropoff location or passenger name, it helps substantiate it was related to the therapy trip. (However, this is not strictly required by OAP; they mainly need the cost and date with a legitimate provider.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="78" data-line-end="79"><em>Why these matter:</em> The OAP needs to confirm that transportation was for the purpose of accessing a service for your child. Travel costs for families to get to a service are explicitly eligible under core funding​<a href="https://www.atamic-canada.com/oap-approved-therapy#:~:text=and%20staff%20orientation%20and%20training,to%20support%20service%20delivery">atamic-canada.com</a>. In practice, parents have successfully claimed taxi and Uber fares by providing the standard receipt (for example, an emailed Uber receipt or a paper taxi meter slip) with no issues, as long as the trip was to or from an approved service.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="80" data-line-end="81"><strong>Example 2.2: Therapy Service Invoice</strong> – <em>E.g., an ABA therapy session from a provider.</em> A proper invoice from a service provider should have:</p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="82" data-line-end="84">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="82" data-line-end="83"><strong>Provider’s Name, Address, and Contact:</strong> (Usually on letterhead or invoice header). This establishes that it’s a legitimate business or practitioner. If the provider is a private therapist, their name and maybe professional registration number might appear. Many invoices also include an HST/GST number if the provider charges tax – while not explicitly listed in OAP guidelines, including the tax registration number is good practice for validity (some parents noted receipts missing an HST number have caused delays).</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="84" data-line-end="86">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="84" data-line-end="85"><strong>Invoice Date and/or Service Date:</strong> The date the invoice was issued (or the dates of sessions covered). This must fall within your approved funding period.</p>

<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="86" data-line-end="88">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="86" data-line-end="87"><strong>Description of Services:</strong> For example, <em>“10 hours ABA therapy in March 2025”</em> or <em>“Speech Therapy session – 1 hour on 2025-02-15.”</em> It should be clear what service was provided and ideally the child’s name or client ID to link it to your child.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="88" data-line-end="90">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="88" data-line-end="89"><strong>Amount Charged and Paid:</strong> The cost for the service. If you’ve paid it, the invoice might show a zero balance or be marked <strong>“Paid”</strong> with the date of payment. If not, a receipt (proof of payment) attached or noted works. Since OAP funding works on reimbursement, you should pay first and then claim – the program wants proof you actually incurred the expense.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="90" data-line-end="91">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="90" data-line-end="91"><strong>Signature or Receipt Number:</strong> Not all invoices need a signature, but some receipts (like for direct pay) might have a signature from the provider or an invoice number. The <strong>invoice number</strong> helps with reference but isn’t strictly required for OAP as long as other details are present.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="93" data-line-end="94">Most therapy providers familiar with OAP will issue receipts that meet these criteria. Ensure the invoice is made out to you (the parent/guardian) or at least references your child, to avoid any doubt that it’s your expense.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="95" data-line-end="96"><strong>Example 2.3: Equipment or Technology Purchase Receipt</strong> – <em>E.g., an iPad or a specialized therapy tool you bought upon a professional’s recommendation.</em> Valid receipts for equipment must have:</p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="97" data-line-end="99">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="97" data-line-end="98"><strong>Vendor Name and Details:</strong> e.g., <em>Best Buy #123, Address…</em> or the online retailer’s name on the invoice. We need to see it came from a legitimate store or supplier.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="99" data-line-end="101">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="99" data-line-end="100"><strong>Date of Purchase:</strong> Again, must be within the funding window or as allowed by your funding letter.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="101" data-line-end="103">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="101" data-line-end="102"><strong>Item Description:</strong> The receipt should list what was purchased (e.g., <em>“iPad 10.2-inch 64GB”</em> or <em>“Noise-cancelling headphones”</em>). This is important because OAP will only reimburse allowable items. The description on the receipt will be checked against the letter of recommendation and the eligible category. For instance, technology like an iPad is allowed <strong>only</strong> if recommended in a therapy plan​<a href="https://www.atamic-canada.com/oap-approved-therapy#:~:text=%2A%20,of%20the%20child%2Fyouth%E2%80%99s%20treatment%20plan">atamic-canada.com</a>, so the item on the receipt should match what the letter describes.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="103" data-line-end="105">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="103" data-line-end="104"><strong>Amount Paid:</strong> The price of the item, including tax. If multiple items are on one receipt, highlight which item(s) you are claiming (you can only claim eligible items – for example, if you bought an iPad and a TV in the same transaction, the TV is not claimable under OAP guidelines​<a href="https://www.atamic-canada.com/oap-approved-therapy#:~:text=%2A%20,hot%20tubs%20and%20playground%20equipment">atamic-canada.com</a>, so you’d only list the iPad’s portion).</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="105" data-line-end="107">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="105" data-line-end="106"><strong>Proof of Payment:</strong> Typically the receipt will show that you paid (cash, credit card last four digits, etc.). Keep the transaction slip or email confirmation as well, though usually the itemized receipt is enough.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="107" data-line-end="108">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="107" data-line-end="108"><strong>Letter of Recommendation:</strong> <em>This isn’t part of the receipt, but it’s a required attachment.</em> Make sure you <strong>upload the therapist’s/doctor’s letter</strong> that recommends this item, alongside the receipt. The letter should ideally include: the child’s name, the date, the professional’s credentials and contact, a statement recommending the specific item (or type of item) for the child’s therapeutic needs, and how it ties into their OAP service plan. OAP policy explicitly states _“Invoices for technology must be accompanied by a letter of recommendation from a regulated professional or Board Certified Behaviour Analyst (BCBA) … delivering or overseeing services to the child”_​<a href="https://www.atamic-canada.com/oap-approved-therapy#:~:text=%2A%20,overseeing%20services%20to%20the%20child">atamic-canada.com</a>, and similarly for program materials or equipment​<a href="https://www.atamic-canada.com/oap-approved-therapy#:~:text=%2A%20,to%20support%20a%20child%2Fyouth%E2%80%99s%20goals">atamic-canada.com</a>. Without the letter, the receipt alone will <strong>not</strong> be approved, so this pairing is crucial.</p>

</ul>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="110" data-line-end="111"><strong>Example 2.4: Deposit for Future Program (Camps/Therapies)</strong> – <em>E.g., a summer camp deposit paid in the spring.</em> This is a tricky area. A receipt for a deposit might show:</p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="112" data-line-end="114">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="112" data-line-end="113"><strong>Provider/Camp Name:</strong> e.g., <em>“Awesome Summer Camp 2025”</em>, with contact info.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="114" data-line-end="115"><strong>Date Paid and Amount:</strong> e.g., <em>“Deposit received on April 10, 2025 – $500”</em>. It may also state the total camp fee (e.g., $2,000 with $500 paid as deposit, balance due later).</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="116" data-line-end="118">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="116" data-line-end="117"><strong>What the Deposit Is For:</strong> e.g., <em>“1-week August day camp for [Child’s Name] in Aug 2025.”</em> This indicates the service (camp) and when it will occur.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="118" data-line-end="119">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="118" data-line-end="119"><strong>Payment Confirmation:</strong> Could be a receipt from an online payment or a signed note from the organization that they received your deposit.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="121" data-line-end="122"><em>Will OAP accept this?</em> According to both official guidelines and service providers, <strong>advance deposits generally are not reimbursed until the service is delivered</strong>. The reasoning is that OAP funds are meant for <strong>services received within the funding period</strong>. If your funding period is, say, April 1, 2024 to March 31, 2025, paying in March 2025 for an August 2025 camp means the service falls outside your period. Even if you have a receipt for the deposit, the program may reject it because it’s an advance payment. In fact, one provider’s FAQ notes: _“as per the OAP funding guidelines, advanced payments/deposits are not covered by AccessOAP.”_​<a href="https://endlessabilities.ca/faqs/#:~:text=FAQs%20,not%20covered%20by%20Access%20OAP">endlessabilities.ca</a>.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="123" data-line-end="124"><strong>How to handle future programs?</strong> If the camp or program starts in a new funding period (or after your current one ends), you likely need to wait and claim the expense in that new period’s funding. One strategy some parents use is to pay the full camp fee up-front <em>during</em> the funding period in order to claim it (essentially treating it as pre-paying for a service, which was allowed under the old Childhood Budgets to use up funds). However, under the current rules this is risky — if the service is entirely outside your period, OAP might deem it ineligible even if paid now. A safer approach is to discuss with your <strong>OAP care coordinator:</strong> explain you have an upcoming service for your child, and ask how it can be covered. They might advise waiting for the next funding allocation or provide documentation that the service will occur in the next period.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="125" data-line-end="126"><strong>Example 2.5: Late-in-Period Expenses (End of Funding Period Purchases)</strong> – <em>E.g., you bought something or had a therapy session just before your funding period ended.</em> The receipts in this scenario might be dated on the last day or week of your period. They should include all the usual info (provider, date, amount). OAP will accept them as long as the date is <strong>on or before your funding end date</strong>. If your period ended March 31 and you have a receipt dated March 30, it’s valid. You will then include it on the expense report for that period (even if you only submit the report after the period ends – you typically have a grace window to compile and submit, e.g. 60 days​<a href="https://peelautismresourceblog.wordpress.com/2021/02/08/oap-expense-tracking-form/#:~:text=If%20you%E2%80%99ve%20received%20a%20Childhood,and%20sent%20all%20at%20once">peelautismresourceblog.wordpress.com</a>).</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="127" data-line-end="128">One common example: A clinician provides a <em>“letter of recommendation”</em> for a device on the last week of your period, but you haven’t purchased the device yet. If you run out and buy it on March 31 and get a receipt, you can claim it for that period. If you wait until April 1, that purchase falls into the next period (and <strong>you’d need a new letter dated in that next period</strong> – see FAQ). Always time your purchases with your funding cycle if possible. The <strong>receipt’s date is what counts</strong> for OAP, not when you submit it.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="129" data-line-end="130"><strong>Summary of Required Receipt Information:</strong> No matter the type, make sure each receipt you submit has at least:</p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="131" data-line-end="133">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="131" data-line-end="132"><strong>Who</strong> you paid (organization or person’s name, and contact if possible).</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="133" data-line-end="135">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="133" data-line-end="134"><strong>When</strong> you paid (date).</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="135" data-line-end="137">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="135" data-line-end="136"><strong>What</strong> it was for (description of service or item).</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="137" data-line-end="139">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="137" data-line-end="138"><strong>How much</strong> you paid (amount, with currency, and tax breakdown if applicable).</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="139" data-line-end="141"><strong>Proof</strong> that you paid (receipt, or invoice showing paid status).<br>
If any of these are missing, try to get the provider to issue a more detailed receipt or provide supplementary documentation. For instance, if a small business therapist doesn’t automatically put their address or HST number, you can ask them for a <strong>complete invoice</strong>. This can prevent delays or rejection. Remember, the ministry can audit and ask for these receipts later to ensure the funds were properly used​<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/ontarioautismcoalition/posts/10161507183158645/#:~:text=,receipts%2C%20so%20keep%20prior%20years">facebook.com</a>, so having thorough documentation now will save future headaches.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="143" data-line-end="144">Having illustrated what receipts and documentation should look like, let’s clarify the timelines and rules around funding periods, which determine <em>when</em> and <em>for which expenses</em> you can seek reimbursement.</p>
<h2 class="code-line" data-line-start=145 data-line-end=146 ><a id="3_Timeline__Eligibility_Chart_for_Funding_Periods_145"></a>3. Timeline &amp; Eligibility Chart for Funding Periods</h2>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="147" data-line-end="148">Understanding your OAP funding period is crucial for planning expenses and submissions. The <strong>funding period</strong> is the active time window in which you can incur expenses that are payable by a given chunk of OAP funding. Here’s a breakdown of typical timelines and some nuances:</p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="149" data-line-end="151">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="149" data-line-end="150"><strong>Funding Allocation Letter Issued:</strong> When you are awarded OAP funding (either through the core services needs-based allocation or previously through a Childhood Budget), you’ll receive a letter or notice stating the amount and the period it covers. For example, you might be given $20,000 for the period of April 1, 2024 to March 31, 2025. Mark the <strong>start and end dates</strong> in your calendar.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="151" data-line-end="153">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="151" data-line-end="152"><strong>Spending Window (Start to End Date):</strong> You can only claim for services delivered and purchases made <strong>within these dates</strong>. This means if your period ends on March 31, you shouldn’t plan services beyond that date on that year’s funds (unless you know an extension or renewal is in place). Unused funds generally <strong>do not carry over</strong> beyond the end date – any amount not spent by then typically cannot be claimed and would remain with the government (for direct payments, they might ask unspent portions to be returned or will deduct from future allocations). <em>Plan your child’s therapies and purchases accordingly so you utilize the funding during the period.</em></p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="153" data-line-end="162">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="153" data-line-end="154"><strong>Mid-Period Reporting / Installments:</strong> If your annual allocation is large, OAP might give it in parts. According to OAP guidelines, families with allocations under $25,000/year receive the full amount <a href="http://xn--upfrontontario-642h.ca">upfront​ontario.ca</a> (in one or two installments), whereas higher allocations might involve more frequent reporting or direct billing. For instance, some families received 50% upfront and must submit an expense report to get the remaining 50%. In such cases, a <strong>mid-period submission</strong> (perhaps at the 6-month mark) is required. The timeline might look like:</p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="155" data-line-end="157">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="155" data-line-end="156"><em>Month 0:</em> Receive first installment (e.g. $10k of $20k).</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="157" data-line-end="159">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="157" data-line-end="158"><em>By Month 6:</em> Submit expenses showing roughly $10k spent (or appropriately used).</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="159" data-line-end="161">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="159" data-line-end="160"><em>Month 7:</em> Receive second installment ($10k).</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="161" data-line-end="162">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="161" data-line-end="162"><em>By Month 12:</em> Submit full expense report for the year.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>(The exact terms will be in your funding agreement. The key is that to get the next payment, you must show you’ve used the current one on eligible expenses​[forms.mgcs.gov.on.ca](https://forms.mgcs.gov.on.ca/dataset/on00294#:~:text=Ontario%20Autism%20Program%20,Reporting%20for%20Core%20Clinical%20Services).)
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="166" data-line-end="168">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="166" data-line-end="167"><strong>End of Funding Period:</strong> This is the deadline for expenses. Try to have all services delivered by this date. If you have a block of therapy hours that extends just past the cut-off, talk to your coordinator – in some cases they might adjust the start of the next period to avoid gaps, but generally the rule is firm: no reimbursement for services provided after the end date under that year’s funds.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="168" data-line-end="170">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="168" data-line-end="169"><strong>Expense Submission Deadline:</strong> After the period ends, you are typically given a short grace period to submit final expenses. Historically, for Childhood Budgets/Interim funding, it was <strong>60 days after the end date</strong> to turn in the expense form​<a href="https://peelautismresourceblog.wordpress.com/2021/02/08/oap-expense-tracking-form/#:~:text=If%20you%E2%80%99ve%20received%20a%20Childhood,and%20sent%20all%20at%20once">peelautismresourceblog.wordpress.com</a>. Under AccessOAP, since many families submit as they go, the “deadline” is effectively the same end date – you’d want everything in by then or shortly after. However, if you still have a few receipts trickling in (e.g. a therapist only gave you an invoice a week after services), you should still be able to submit those as long as the service date was before the period end. It’s wise not to wait too long, as delays could complicate your reconciliation or next funding release.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="170" data-line-end="172">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="170" data-line-end="171"><strong>Review &amp; Reconciliation (Post-Period):</strong> Once you submit your final expenses for that period, the program will reconcile the funds. If you spent less than the full allocation, they may note an unused amount. <em>In earlier programs, families had to return unspent money or the ministry would claw it back; with AccessOAP, since they typically only disburse what you need per installment, this is less of an issue.</em> But importantly, if you <strong>didn’t use all funds</strong> and the period is over, you <strong>lose access to those remaining dollars</strong> – they don’t roll over for your child (the only exception is if an official extension is granted in extraordinary circumstances). Plan to use your allocation fully on eligible supports for your child within each period.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="172" data-line-end="173">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="172" data-line-end="173"><strong>Next Funding Period / Renewal:</strong> OAP is meant to be ongoing annually (until the child ages out or the program changes). Usually, near the end of one period, you will undergo a renewal or “determination of needs” update and then get a letter for the next period’s funding. However, the next period’s funding might be contingent on settling the previous one. For example, if you haven’t submitted your expense report for year 1, they might delay releasing year 2 funds. Once everything from the prior period is accounted for, you should receive the next allocation letter and payment. Keep an eye on your portal for a new funding agreement to sign for the next year.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="175" data-line-end="176">Below is a <strong>timeline chart</strong> illustrating a sample 12-month funding cycle:</p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="177" data-line-end="179">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="177" data-line-end="178"><strong>Month 1 (Start of Period)</strong> – Receive funding letter and first payment. Begin incurring expenses (therapy sessions start, purchase needed tools with letters of recommendation as required).</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="179" data-line-end="181">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="179" data-line-end="180"><strong>Months 2–5</strong> – Continue services. Submit expenses periodically via portal; monitor spending vs budget.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="181" data-line-end="183">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="181" data-line-end="182"><strong>Month 6</strong> – Mid-point check: If applicable, submit interim expense report to trigger second installment. Receive second payment if all is in order.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="183" data-line-end="185">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="183" data-line-end="184"><strong>Months 7–11</strong> – Continue using services. If considering expensive items or new programs, ensure letters of recommendation are obtained well before purchase. By Month 11, start planning to use any remaining funds (e.g., schedule intensives or purchase approved therapy materials) – avoid a last-minute scramble or unspent funds.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="185" data-line-end="187">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="185" data-line-end="186"><strong>Month 12 (End of Period)</strong> – Deadline for services. Ensure all sessions occur by this time. If a service can’t be delivered by this date, it should be scheduled under next period instead.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="187" data-line-end="189">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="187" data-line-end="188"><strong>+1–2 months post-period</strong> – Finalize and submit any remaining receipts (e.g., the last month’s therapy invoices). Complete the official expense reconciliation form if required. OAP reviews the submission.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="189" data-line-end="190">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="189" data-line-end="190"><strong>Next Period Start</strong> – New funding kicks in (if your child remains eligible and on the program), typically seamlessly if previous reporting was completed. New period rules apply (e.g., you’ll need new letters for any equipment you plan to purchase in the new period, even if you had one last year – see FAQ).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="192" data-line-end="193"><strong>Key Eligibility Nuances:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="194" data-line-end="196">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="194" data-line-end="195"><strong>Letters of Recommendation Validity:</strong> These letters are generally tied to a specific period’s plan. Parents have reported that you can reuse the same letter for multiple purchases <strong>within the same funding period</strong> (for example, if an OT’s letter says your child needs various sensory items, you can buy a few of those items in that year with the one letter). However, <strong>once a new period starts, a new letter is required</strong> with the current date/year and possibly updated justification​<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/ontarioautismcoalition/posts/10160674578213645/#:~:text=,new%20one%20with%20the">facebook.com</a>. This is because each period’s funding allocation is a separate agreement – the program wants current confirmation that an expense is needed for that period’s plan.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="196" data-line-end="198">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="196" data-line-end="197"><strong>Date of Expense vs. Date of Submission:</strong> Only the date of service/purchase must lie within the funding period. You can submit the receipt after the fact (within the allowed submission window). Conversely, even if you submit early, if the service date is future (beyond your current period), they will not approve it now.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="198" data-line-end="200">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="198" data-line-end="199"><strong>Expense Eligibility Changes:</strong> Be aware that what was allowed under the old Childhood Budgets might not be under core services. For instance, camps, recreational classes, or respite workers were eligible uses of Childhood Budgets, but under <strong>Core Clinical Services funding, those are typically <strong>not</strong> covered</strong> because the focus is on clinical (therapeutic) services. The eligible expense categories now are narrower​<a href="https://www.atamic-canada.com/oap-approved-therapy#:~:text=,Time%20Funding">atamic-canada.com</a>​<a href="https://www.atamic-canada.com/oap-approved-therapy#:~:text=Ineligible%20expenses%20">atamic-canada.com</a>. If you’re transitioning from one model to another, double-check the current eligibility list (see official guidelines or ask your coordinator) before assuming an expense can be claimed.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="200" data-line-end="201">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="200" data-line-end="201"><strong>Rollover vs Renewal:</strong> It’s worth emphasizing that <strong>unspent funding does not roll over</strong> automatically. Each allocation is “use it or lose it,” except in special transitional arrangements. For example, during the switch to needs-based OAP, families who had Interim Funding were sometimes given a chance to renew once if they hadn’t been admitted to core services​<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ontario/comments/1buqvmf/returning_autism_funding/#:~:text=Returning%20Autism%20funding%20%24%20%3A,invitation%20to%20Core%20Clinical%20Services">reddit.com</a>, but that was a structured policy, not a true rollover of leftover money. In day-to-day use, plan as if your child’s budget resets each year and you start fresh (with new approvals needed for certain things).</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="203" data-line-end="204">This timeline and rules overview should help you schedule services and submissions appropriately. Next, we move on to a Q&amp;A section, addressing common real-world questions parents have (like “Can I claim Uber rides?” “What if my receipt is missing info?” “What if I got the letter late?”) with answers based on both official policy and community experience.</p>
<h2 class="code-line" data-line-start=205 data-line-end=206 ><a id="4_FAQ__RealWorld_Questions_from_Parents_and_Answers_205"></a>4. FAQ – Real-World Questions from Parents (and Answers)</h2>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="207" data-line-end="209"><strong>Q1: Can I get reimbursed for transportation costs like taxis or Uber rides to therapy?</strong><br>
<strong>A:</strong> Yes. Transportation to get your child to and from an eligible service is an allowable expense in the OAP. The guidelines include <em>“travel expenses, including transportation costs for families to travel to a service provider,”</em> as eligible​<a href="https://www.atamic-canada.com/oap-approved-therapy#:~:text=and%20staff%20orientation%20and%20training,to%20support%20service%20delivery">atamic-canada.com</a>. Parents in the program have successfully claimed taxi fares, Uber rides, public transit fares, and even mileage in some cases. To claim these, make sure you have a receipt or proof of the fare (Uber receipts, transit pass receipt, parking receipt, etc.) and that the date aligns with a therapy session. In the portal, enter it under travel or transportation category. One tip: if your therapy provider charges a travel fee to come to you, that will usually be on their invoice (and you would not separately claim anything). If <em>you</em> arrange transport, then you claim it yourself. Keep the cost reasonable (take the most economical option feasible – e.g., standard taxi vs. luxury car) because the guidelines expect the “most economical option” for expenses​<a href="https://www.atamic-canada.com/oap-approved-therapy#:~:text=%2A%20,to%20support%20a%20child%2Fyouth%E2%80%99s%20goals">atamic-canada.com</a>. Generally, routine transportation claims are approved without issue as long as you have receipts.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="210" data-line-end="212"><strong>Q2: What information needs to be on a receipt for it to be accepted?</strong><br>
<strong>A:</strong> The receipt should look professional and answer the basics of who/what/when/where/how much. Specifically, ensure it has:</p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="213" data-line-end="215">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="213" data-line-end="214"><strong>Vendor/Provider Name</strong> and contact (address or phone ideally). This shows who was paid.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="215" data-line-end="217">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="215" data-line-end="216"><strong>Date of transaction</strong> (or service date) – proving it occurred during the authorized timeframe.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="217" data-line-end="219">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="217" data-line-end="218"><strong>Description of the service or item</strong> – so reviewers know it’s an eligible service (ABA therapy, SLP session, etc.) or item (sensory toy, tablet for communication, etc.).</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="219" data-line-end="221">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="219" data-line-end="220"><strong>Amount paid</strong> (with currency, and tax breakdown or tax number if applicable). They need the exact figure to reimburse and to verify any taxes paid are legitimate (some providers include their HST number which is good to have).</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="221" data-line-end="222">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="221" data-line-end="222"><strong>Proof of payment</strong> – usually inherent in a receipt (marked “Paid” or a zero balance). For invoices, a signature or receipt ID helps; for store purchases, the receipt itself implies payment. If the receipt is an order confirmation, ensure it also shows that you paid (or pair it with a payment confirmation).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="224" data-line-end="225">If any of these are missing, the claim might get flagged. For example, a parent asked if an expense could be rejected because the receipt didn’t have an HST number – while OAP hasn’t officially stated every receipt must have an HST number, a missing tax number on a business invoice could raise questions. The safe approach is: <strong>if you’re dealing with a professional or business, ask for a proper invoice.</strong> If you only got a handwritten receipt, make sure it has at least a signature and contact info. For a support worker or sole proprietor (like a one-person tutor), have them include their name, address, and a phrase like “Received $X for services – Paid in full” with date and signature. Autism Ontario’s reimbursement programs, for instance, required receipts that contain the full name and address of the provider, amount, date, and provider’s <a href="http://xn--signatureautismontario-yv5m.com">signature​autismontario.com</a> – it’s a good model to follow for OAP too, even if OAP doesn’t explicitly list it on the website.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="226" data-line-end="228"><strong>Q3: Do I need to provide a letter of recommendation for every expense?</strong><br>
<strong>A:</strong> No, not for every expense – only certain types of expenses require a letter of recommendation from a qualified professional. Regular therapy services (ABA, speech, OT, etc.) <strong>do not</strong> need a letter because those are assumed to be part of your child’s service plan already. The cases where a letter <strong>is needed</strong> are typically:</p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="229" data-line-end="231">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="229" data-line-end="230"><strong>Technology purchases</strong> (like computers, tablets, specialized apps): OAP rules state that these must be recommended by a professional and included in the child’s plan​<a href="https://www.atamic-canada.com/oap-approved-therapy#:~:text=%2A%20,of%20the%20child%2Fyouth%E2%80%99s%20treatment%20plan">atamic-canada.com</a>. You need a letter (from a therapist, BCBA, SLP, OT, psychologist, etc.) explaining why that technology is necessary for the child’s therapy goals​<a href="https://www.atamic-canada.com/oap-approved-therapy#:~:text=%2A%20,overseeing%20services%20to%20the%20child">atamic-canada.com</a>.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="231" data-line-end="233">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="231" data-line-end="232"><strong>Therapy equipment or materials</strong> (e.g., a therapy swing, weighted blanket, PECs communication binder, etc.): Similarly, these require a professional’s recommendation in writing​<a href="https://www.atamic-canada.com/oap-approved-therapy#:~:text=%2A%20,to%20support%20a%20child%2Fyouth%E2%80%99s%20goals">atamic-canada.com</a>.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="233" data-line-end="234">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="233" data-line-end="234"><strong>Possibly some non-clinical services</strong>: Under core services funding, most non-clinical services aren’t funded, so there’s not a letter that can make an ineligible expense eligible. (In older funding, a letter might have been used to justify something like tutoring or a specialized camp as beneficial, but under current rules those likely remain ineligible even with a letter.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="236" data-line-end="237">If in doubt, ask your care coordinator if a particular item needs a letter. Generally, if it’s not a directly therapeutic service but a tool or device, assume a letter is needed. When you have a letter, <strong>upload it alongside the receipt when submitting</strong>. Each letter should clearly state the professional’s name, title, how they know your child (e.g., supervising BCBA or Occupational Therapist), and the specific item/service being recommended for funding. The letter should be dated within the current funding period to be valid for that period’s expenses.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="238" data-line-end="240"><strong>Q4: I got a letter of recommendation for an item right at the end of my funding period. Can I still use it if my funding rolled over to a new period?</strong><br>
<strong>A:</strong> The timing here is important. If you receive a recommendation letter at the tail end of your period, you have two choices: either purchase the item immediately in that period or wait and likely get a new letter for the next period. <strong>Letters do not automatically carry over</strong> to a new funding period. Each OAP funding period is treated separately. In practice, families have found that _a letter can be reused for multiple purchases in the same period, but once the next period starts, a new letter (with a new date) is required_​<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/ontarioautismcoalition/posts/10160674578213645/#:~:text=,new%20one%20with%20the">facebook.com</a>. This is because the ministry wants confirmation that the need still exists in the new period and to document it properly in the new funding agreement.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="241" data-line-end="242">If your funding “rolled over” in the sense that you got a new allocation for a new year, you should contact the professional who provided the original letter and ask if they can issue an updated letter dated in the new fiscal period, reaffirming the recommendation (they might even use the same wording). Attach the new letter when you submit the expense under the new funding. If, however, your situation is that the ministry extended your existing period (which is rare but possible in certain transitions), then your original letter would still be valid until that extended end date.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="243" data-line-end="244">Also note: if you <em>did purchase</em> the item in the old period (with the old letter) but didn’t submit in time, you can still submit the receipt in the grace period after period end as long as the purchase date was before the deadline. That will count for the old period. But if you missed actually buying it, you can’t claim it retroactively without having a receipt dated in that period. Thus, new period = treat it as a fresh request with a fresh letter.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="245" data-line-end="247"><strong>Q5: Can I claim a camp or program that happens in the future if I pay for it now?</strong><br>
<strong>A:</strong> Generally, <strong>no</strong> for future programs under the current OAP core funding. The OAP will not pay for services that haven’t occurred yet. They want to fund actual delivered services. For example, paying a deposit in advance for a summer camp (which is more recreation/respite than a clinical service) is not something the core funding is designed to cover ahead of time. As mentioned, AccessOAP’s guidelines explicitly say advanced payments or deposits are not covered​<a href="https://endlessabilities.ca/faqs/#:~:text=FAQs%20,not%20covered%20by%20Access%20OAP">endlessabilities.ca</a>. If the camp is happening in the next funding period, you should plan to use next period’s funds for it. If the camp is within your current period and is an eligible service (some therapeutic social skills groups or specialized camps might qualify if they have a developmental/therapeutic component), you could potentially claim it, but only after the service (camp) is delivered, or at least once you’ve paid in full and the camp is imminent within the period.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="248" data-line-end="249">For practical purposes, core OAP funding is not as flexible as the previous Childhood Budgets (which allowed camps and respite broadly). If attending a camp or similar, check if it falls under any OAP service category. Most likely it doesn’t, meaning you might have to use other funding sources (such as Autism Ontario’s respite camp funding programs or Special Services at Home, etc.) for camps. Always verify with your coordinator: some families interpret any beneficial program as claimable, but OAP may disagree. To avoid denied claims, get clarity <em>before</em> paying large sums.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="250" data-line-end="252"><strong>Q6: How long does it take to get reimbursed after I submit receipts?</strong><br>
<strong>A:</strong> The timeline can vary:</p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="253" data-line-end="255">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="253" data-line-end="254">Simple, routine therapy services are often quick. Many parents see approvals within days to a week for standard invoices (especially smaller ones)​<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/ontarioautismcoalition/posts/10160758962513645/#:~:text=,If%20they%20are">facebook.com</a>. If you already have the funding (direct payment), there’s no “reimbursement” per se – it just gets approved and you know those funds were correctly used. If you are expecting a payment (e.g., second installment or a one-time reimbursement), it might come roughly 1–2 weeks after approval.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="255" data-line-end="257">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="255" data-line-end="256">More complex or high-value items take longer. Equipment or unusual expenses that require review can take several weeks. One anecdote: <em>“They are taking around 6-8 weeks to process, way longer with equipment and sensory stuff (even with the OT or BCBA letter)”</em>, as this delay has been a “real concern” for parents​<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/ontarioautismcoalition/posts/10160091798733645/#:~:text=Facebook%20www,which%20is%20a%20real%20concern">facebook.com</a>. This seems to be the upper end, but be prepared for potentially a month or two of waiting on big-ticket claims, especially if the program administrators need to double-check eligibility or if many families are submitting at the same time (end of fiscal year rush).</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="257" data-line-end="258">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="257" data-line-end="258">If any issues are found (missing info, etc.), that can delay things until you respond. To speed up your reimbursement, ensure everything is complete when you submit to avoid back-and-forth.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="260" data-line-end="261">Also, keep in mind government payment processing times – even after approval, actual direct deposit runs might only happen on certain days. If you see “Processed” in the portal but no deposit yet, it could be in the next scheduled batch (for example, some noted deposits often hit on Wednesdays)​<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/ontarioautismcoalition/posts/10161216200298645/#:~:text=Just%20a%20question%20how%20long,not%20today%2C%20next%20week%20then">facebook.com</a>.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="262" data-line-end="264"><strong>Q7: The portal is confusing – how do I know the status of my submissions or if I did it right?</strong><br>
<strong>A:</strong> The AccessOAP portal isn’t the most intuitive system, as many caregivers have observed. Here are some tips:</p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="265" data-line-end="267">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="265" data-line-end="266">After logging in, go to the <strong>Funding or Expense Reports</strong> section. There should be a table or list of expenses you’ve submitted. Look for a status column. Common statuses include “Pending Review,” “Approved,” “Processed,” or “Needs Info.”</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="267" data-line-end="269">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="267" data-line-end="268">Some users mentioned that you can click on the status or an info icon to get details​<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/ontarioautismcoalition/posts/10161666051453645/#:~:text=,the%20%E2%80%9Cstatus%E2%80%9D%20column%2C%20click">facebook.com</a>. For example, an expense might show as processed, but you want to see if it was fully accepted – clicking it could show notes or the breakdown of approved amount.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="269" data-line-end="271">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="269" data-line-end="270">If you just see a lump sum or confusing interface, don’t hesitate to use the portal’s <strong>secure message centre</strong> to ask your coordinator for an update. They can confirm if your submission was received correctly.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="271" data-line-end="273">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="271" data-line-end="272">You should also receive correspondence when a new funding agreement is uploaded or when an issue arises (often via email notification telling you to check the portal).</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="273" data-line-end="275">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="273" data-line-end="274"><strong>No news is usually good news.</strong> If weeks go by and you hear nothing, check if the expense amount was deducted from your available funding balance (if you have an ongoing budget). In the absence of a rejection message, it likely is either still in queue or has been quietly approved.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="275" data-line-end="277">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="275" data-line-end="276">Remember, once you submit an expense, you <strong>cannot edit or delete it</strong> on your own. If you spot an error (say you entered $1000 instead of $100), inform your coordinator or the support line immediately – they might be able to correct it internally or advise you to upload a note/letter to clarify. The system not allowing user edits is a known frustration, so double-check entries before hitting submit.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="277" data-line-end="278">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="277" data-line-end="278">The portal does have an <strong>FAQ and Help</strong> section (on AccessOAP’s site), and AccessOAP has a help line (1-833-425-2445) and email (<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#442d2a222b042527272137372b25346a2725"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="157c7b737a557476767066667a74653b7674">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>)​<a href="https://portal.accessoap.ca/faq#:~:text=If%20you%20have%20specific%20questions,in%20using%20the%20portal%20please">portal.accessoap.ca</a>. If you’re stuck on using the portal (e.g., trouble uploading files or navigating), reach out to them. They also run occasional webinars or drop-in sessions to help parents with receipt submission​<a href="https://www.canopysupport.ca/upcoming-events/oap-invoicingapr#:~:text=Parents%2FCaregivers%20www,%C2%B7%20Q%26A%20with">canopysupport.ca</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="280" data-line-end="282"><strong>Q8: What if an expense is denied or deemed ineligible? Can I appeal or reuse the money?</strong><br>
<strong>A:</strong> If an expense is denied, first ensure it wasn’t a misunderstanding. Often “denials” are really requests for more info. But if truly ineligible, the portal will not credit that amount to your funding usage. This means those funds remain (or are returned to) your allocation. You cannot use them for something else after the period has ended (since you’d have no time to redirect), but if you catch it before period end, you could still use that money on a different eligible expense. For example, if you tried to claim a $500 non-eligible service and it’s rejected in Month 10, you still have that $500 available – you might quickly pivot to buy some sensory equipment with a letter, or add an extra therapy session or two before the period ends. There isn’t a formal “appeal” process for individual purchases; decisions are based on the published guidelines. You can, however, speak to your coordinator to understand the reason and see if any additional documentation would change it. If not, accept that it can’t be paid by OAP and don’t count it in your funding use. In the future, always consult the <strong>Eligible Expenses list</strong> (available on Ontario’s website) or your service navigator if you’re unsure about a particular expense.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="283" data-line-end="285"><strong>Q9: I find the official guidance lacking – where can I get more help or clarification?</strong><br>
<strong>A:</strong> You’re not alone. Many families feel the written instructions from the ministry are minimal, and the portal itself doesn’t guide much on what a “proper receipt” is or how to categorize tricky expenses. For help:</p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="286" data-line-end="288">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="286" data-line-end="287"><strong>Autism Ontario Service Navigators:</strong> Autism Ontario (as part of AccessOAP) has navigators who can answer questions one-on-one.

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="290" data-line-end="291"><strong>Official OAP Guidelines Document:</strong> The Ontario government has published detailed <strong>OAP Guidelines</strong> for core services (often a PDF on the <a href="http://ontario.ca">ontario.ca</a> site).

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="292" data-line-end="293"><strong>Care Coordinators:</strong> Once you’re in core services, you should be assigned a care coordinator via AccessOAP. You can message them through the portal or set up a call. They can clarify what’s allowed, and they liaise with the funding admin (Accerta) – so if you have a unique situation, they might get you an answer straight from the source.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="301" data-line-end="302"><strong>Clearer Official Instructions &amp; Checklist:</strong> The OAP should provide a simple checklist or guide (much like this one) on their portal and in the funding approval package. For example, a one-pager on “How to Submit Your Expenses” with screenshots of the portal, and a checklist of what info receipts must have, would greatly reduce guesswork. Currently, families piece together info from phone calls and forums. A clear FAQ on the AccessOAP site specifically about expense submission (covering questions like “Can I prepay?”, “What needs a letter?”, “What format should I use to upload receipts?”) would be very valuable.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="307" data-line-end="308">Allowing users to <strong>edit or correct submissions</strong> that are still in review, rather than locking them out. Perhaps an “edit” button that triggers a note to the reviewer that new info was added.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="317" data-line-end="318"><em>Travel reimbursement standards:</em> If OAP intends to allow mileage (for those who drive their own car) or other travel costs, they should publish a clear method (e.g., a per-kilometer rate or the types of receipts accepted like gas or parking receipts). Currently, families are unsure if personal vehicle costs can be claimed; formal guidance here would help. <em>(If mileage is not allowed, stating that clearly would also help families plan accordingly.)</em></p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="319" data-line-end="320"><em>Camps/Recreation:</em> While core funding is for clinical services, many families feel that specialized camps or social groups are important for their child’s development. If these remain ineligible, the ministry could better signpost families to alternate funding (such as the <strong>Autism Ontario Summer Support Fund</strong><a href="http://xn--autismontario-9j6g.com">​autismontario.com</a> or <strong>Special Services at Home</strong>). Including a note in OAP materials like “Note: Recreational programs are not funded by OAP core services; see Autism Ontario programs for camp support” would at least guide families rather than leaving them confused or attempting to fit these into OAP claims.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="321" data-line-end="322"><strong>Communication and Support:</strong> The introduction of care coordinators is a positive step​<a href="https://portal.accessoap.ca/faq#:~:text=,will%20AccessOAP%20offer%20my%20family">portal.accessoap.ca</a>, but families would benefit from:</p>

<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="323" data-line-end="325">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="323" data-line-end="324">Proactive check-ins, especially for new families after they receive funding. A quick call or message like “Do you understand how to submit expenses? Can I help with your first submission?” would ease a lot of anxiety.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="325" data-line-end="327">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="325" data-line-end="326">Faster helpdesk responses during crunch times (e.g., end of fiscal year). Ensuring the AccessOAP support line is well-staffed when many are submitting (March and April typically) would prevent backlogs.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="327" data-line-end="329">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="327" data-line-end="328">Possibly an improved tutorial on the portal – maybe an interactive walkthrough the first time you use the expense submission feature.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="329" data-line-end="330"><strong>Feedback Loop for Continuous Improvement:</strong> The ministry should collect feedback from parents about why certain submissions fail or what questions they commonly ask. For example, if many claims are coming in with missing info (like no letter for an iPad) and getting delayed, that indicates the instructions didn’t make that requirement obvious. Using that data, OAP could update the portal (maybe a pop-up “You selected Technology – reminder: attach a professional recommendation letter or this claim will be denied.”). This kind of real-time guidance would preempt issues. It appears that families currently rely on trial and error (or community advice) to learn these rules, which shouldn’t be the case.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="332" data-line-end="333">In conclusion, the Ontario Autism Program’s reimbursement process, while navigable, has room to become more user-centric. Until improvements are made, parents and caregivers will have to lean on detailed guides like this and peer support to ensure they submit everything correctly. The good news is that <strong>when done properly, reimbursements are generally successful</strong> – the program does cover a broad range of necessary expenses for your child’s autism support, and knowing the proper procedure will help you get the financial support you’ve been allocated. Always keep records, don’t hesitate to ask questions, and advocate for your child’s needs (with the proper documentation in hand). With the information and tips provided here, you should be well-equipped to handle OAP receipt submissions and get the most out of your funding for your child’s benefit.</p>
